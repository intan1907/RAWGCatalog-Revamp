Partial featured [rawg.io](https://rawg.io) mobile app written in Swift 5 with VIPER architecture.

## Features

## Notes
This project is not intended to provide the full featured app or be published on the store.

This code is free to use. Note that I have removed the `api_key` from `ServiceConfig.plist` that I originally developed this with.
